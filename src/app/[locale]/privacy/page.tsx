                <p>
                  The entire purpose of LangQuest is to preserve and make
                  language data available to everyone. We do not sell language
                  data, and we hope everyone who has any interest in language
                  preservation will use it. We hope others will use this data to
                  create new tools, resources, AI models (text, speech
                  recognition and synthesis, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is very important to our mission that the language data is
                  as usable as possible. We make the database public, and do not
                  require any attribution for using it.
